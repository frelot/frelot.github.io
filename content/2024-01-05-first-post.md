In the last few days of 2023, I spent some time reflecting on what I’d like to do in the coming year. Writing particularly stood out. Other than writing documentation for development efforts at work (every engineer’s favorite pastime), I don’t often write for myself or others. 2024 is the year that changes.

So here we are, I created this blog. I plan to use it as a place to get my thoughts out, and write about topics I find interesting and exciting. It will likely be all over the place until I find my stride, but the important thing is, I’m writing. 

What it becomes is what it will be.
